### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: It/Dude

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m always working on improving my courses for SXU: Web Development ACSG 540 and Full-stack ACSG 542 to upper class undergraduate and masters level students.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about ReactJS! It seems like far more people use it over Angular which has been my bread and butter these past few years.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Video Game development. After failing to deliver on a project with my brother and a close friend, I'd be interested in giving it another go with someone else who needs help with the software side of things. Gained knowledge of Unity from this experience.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me to help with your open source project if you feel overwhelmed! I'm very likely to make time to help if I find the idea or technical stack interesting!
